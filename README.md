## About the project

This is a demonstration of building a web-app that connects to the City of Chicago Data Portal.
It was written primarily in CoffeeScript using [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and the [Chaplin framework](http://chaplinjs.org/) and assembled with [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

Currently, it connects directly to the data source using your web browser. It is hosted and served as static assets via GitHub. To learn more about the data set powering the results from this app, visit the [City of Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/4ijn-s7e5).

The next phase of this project will include a replicated copy of the data set being served by a custom web app to allow better search results.
